# FrontEndCPAPortfolio

A simple HTML , CSS (Bootstrap) and JS Landing page for my CPA Generator. 

This is the front end of a CPA business model I came up a couple of month ago , the main idea is to Keep a Group of loyal users using the popular platform Didcord.com , in this platform we will have a discord bot that it will generate a Token which is later put  in this website.

After the animation, a CPA offer should pop up and block the ussers to get the Account they came looking for unless they complete 1 Ad.

# The Discord Bot

The repository of the discord bot can be found here >> https://github.com/Gus-Gonz/BackEndDiscordCPAPortfolio 

# Note 

You can check the funtionality of this Landing page here >> https://webbackend-realgen.herokuapp.com/ .

Token to be submited as a test > 3C5U8AMSLDBACPB53PF2 .

# CPA Case of Study 

I used Ogads.com as my main CPA network and with free traffic we manege to get a group of arrounr 600 loyal users , archiving an stable $50-$70 per month (https://imgur.com/a/muQrTzE).

In case you want to use this landing page for your own use , you will need to add your own content locker and you will need uncomment the line 160 of the templates/hello2.html , this will call the content locker after you add it.
